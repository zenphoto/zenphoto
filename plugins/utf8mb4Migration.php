/*
 * This plugin is a migration tool to move <var>TEXT</var> and <var>LONGTEXT</var> database fields to
 * <i>utf8mb4</i> encoding and collation. All other <i>text</i> fields are left as <i>utf8</i>.
 *
 * <i>utf8</i> encoding supports only <i>Basic Multilingual Plane</i> (BMP) characters. Many
 * recently defined Emoji characters are coded in with <i>trans-BMP</i> codes. For MySql to
 * handle these the data field character set must be set to <i>utf8mb4</i>. Existing 
 * installations encode all text fields as <i>utf8</i> so trying to store a <i>trans-BMP</i>
 * character will result in data truncation at that character since it is not valid
 * in <i>utf8</i>.
 *
 * You should always backup your database before attempting this migration. <i>utf8</i>
 * is a subset of <i>utf8mb4</i> so all data should migrate successfully. <b>HOWEVER</b>
 * it is possible that the database contains characters which are invalid in <i>utf8mb4</i>.
 * This could cause the migration to fail or to lose data.
 *
 * Your MySQL software version MUST be 5.5.3 or greater to support utf8mb4 encodings. The migration
 * tool will be disabled if your MySQL version is less than this.
