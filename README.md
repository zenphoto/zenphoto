Welcome to the Zenphoto git repository!

About Zenphoto
--------------

Zenphoto is a standalone CMS for multimedia focused websites. Our focus lies on being easy to use and having all the features there when you need them (but out of the way if you do not.)

Zenphoto features support for images, video and audio formats, and the Zenpage CMS plugin provides a fully integrated news section (blog) and custom pages to run entire websites.

This makes Zenphoto the ideal CMS for personal websites of illustrators, artists, designers, photographers, film makers and musicians.

Status
------

We're currently in the process of migrating from SVN to Git, so some things may be messy while we get settled.

Our old Subversion repository is here: http://www.zenphoto.org/svn - development has ceased there as of Oct 19 2012.

Older builds may be found here: http://www.zenphoto.org/files/

As of Oct 19th 2012, all release builds will be available on the Downloads page of this github repository [or via this direct link](https://github.com/zenphoto/zenphoto/zipball/master). Nightly builds will be discontinued in favor of zip packages of the repository available from the "Code" view, or a simple `git clone` to check out the latest code. All problem reports for this release should be filed as GitHub issues!
