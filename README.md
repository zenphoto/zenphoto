# Releases

The current "official" release (and all previous ones) may be found at [Releases] (https://github.com/ZenPhoto20/ZenPhoto20/releases)

Tagged releases include a single file install package for ease of installation. Instructions for its use are included in the download. 

ZenPhoto20 will be updated incrementally via GitHub. We will tag reases when new features are added or significant bugs are fixed. There will not be a fixed release cycle nor a "Development" stream.

Our development methodology is structured to insure that the _master_ branch of the repository remains stable. So if you wish to have the most recent fixes you can safely install the _master_ branch. But there is no means to include the single file install with the branch, so it is available only on taged releases.


# About ZenPhoto20

ZenPhoto20 is a standalone CMS for multimedia focused websites. Our focus lies on being easy to use and having all the features there when you need them (but out of the way if you do not.)

ZenPhoto20 features support for images, video and audio formats, a news section (blog), and custom pages to run entire websites.

This makes ZenPhoto20 the ideal CMS for personal websites of illustrators, artists, designers, photographers, film makers and musicians.


ZenPhoto20 was created with a fork of the Zenphoto repository at the time of the Zenphoto 1.4.6 release.
The intent of this branching is to clean up the years of detritus that the original code accumulated. At the same time
the we intend to modernize the support process and enable third party contributors to easily get their works attached to the release packages.
