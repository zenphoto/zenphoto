About Zenphoto
--------------

Zenphoto is a standalone CMS for multimedia focused websites. Our focus lies on being easy to use and having all the features there when you need them (but out of the way if you do not.)

Zenphoto features support for images, video and audio formats, and the Zenpage CMS plugin provides a fully integrated news section (blog) and custom pages to run entire websites.

This makes Zenphoto the ideal CMS for personal websites of illustrators, artists, designers, photographers, film makers and musicians.

Support
------

There is a support forum for Zenphoto discussions  at www.zenphoto.org/support.

Zenphoto interim builds are available on github  via this direct link (https://github.com/zenphoto/zenphoto/zipball/master).  All problem reports should be filed as GitHub issues.
