# netPhotoGraphicsâ„¢ (formerly ZenPhoto20) 

# Releases

The current "official" release (and all previous ones) may be found at [Releases](https://github.com/ZenPhoto20/netPhotoGraphics/releases)

Tagged releases include one or more single file install packages for ease of installation. Instructions for its use are included in the download. (Interim install packages are created to incorporate minor updates to the software.)

netPhotoGraphics will be updated incrementally via GitHub. We will tag releases when new features are added or significant bugs are fixed. There will not be a fixed release cycle nor a "Development" stream.

Our development methodology is structured to insure that the _master_ branch of the repository remains stable. So if you wish to have the most recent fixes you can safely install the _master_ branch. There is no means to include the single file install with the branch, so they are available only on tagged releases.


# About netPhotoGraphics

netPhotoGraphics is a standalone CMS for multimedia focused websites. Our focus lies on being easy to use and having all the features there when you need them (but out of the way if you do not.)

netPhotoGraphics features support for images, video and audio formats, a news section (blog), and custom pages to run entire websites.

This makes netPhotoGraphics the ideal CMS for personal websites of illustrators, artists, designers, photographers, film makers and musicians.


netPhotoGraphics was created with a fork of the Zenphoto repository at the time of the Zenphoto 1.4.6 release. It spent the first four years of its life as ZenPhoto20. In 2018 the name was changed to netPhotoGraphics.
The intent of the branching was to clean up the years of detritus that the original code accumulated. At the same time
the we modernized the software, the support process, and the integration of third party contributor.
